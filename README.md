# Small Real Estate App


Real state demo application.

# Summary
The intention of this project was to focus on the development of reusable and testable components that could be integrated as par or as the fundamental library of a broader system. 
The test coverage focused on simulating the user flow and test the interactions against the expected result display.

Technologies:
  - React(CRA)
  - Eslint/Prettier
  - Css Modules
  - Fetch api service
  - Hooks
  - Typescript
  - Test (testing-library/react/enzyme)

# Improvements for a real world production version

  - Create a theme functionality to manage styles between modules/components
  - Implementation of state management functionality eg. Redux/React Hooks(useContext, use Reducer)
  - Expand test coverage to include e2e, implementation test and unit test for the layout functional components
